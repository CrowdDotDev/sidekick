+= 0-system.txt

When parsing markdown files we want a chunk for each non-heading piece of text.  For example, if the file looks like this:

```
# heading
## sub-heading
This text,

potentially several paragraphs.

### Sub-sub-heading

This other text

## another sub-heading

And yet another text
```

we would  want an array containing three elements. Each element has the chain of headings that lead to the text, and the text.

Can you write the markdown parser?
